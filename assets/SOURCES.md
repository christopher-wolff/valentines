# Asset Sources

To avoid Git push failures in environments that disallow binary files, the character assets are now text-based SVGs created in-repo and committed as plain text.

Included assets:

- `bunny-1.svg` — shy/initial state
- `bunny-2.svg` — hopeful/eager state
- `bunny-3.svg` — extra eager (heart eyes) state
- `bunny-dance.svg` — dancing celebration animation (SVG SMIL)

These assets are self-contained and require no runtime external media URLs.
